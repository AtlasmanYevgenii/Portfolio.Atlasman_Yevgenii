[Click here to check out the project using nbviewer (recommended)](https://nbviewer.org/github/AtlasmanYevgenii/Practicum100-by-Yandex/blob/dcbb5b1c0c90f1c6b9dd7a8209ef9fd6d6ee2ebe/1.%20Analyzing%20borrowers%E2%80%99%20risk%20of%20defaulting.ipynb#chapter00)

Our project is to prepare a report for a bank's loan division. We'll need to find out if a customer's marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers' credit worthiness.

The main aim of the project is to build a credit scoring of a potential customer. The credit scoring is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.

**Plan of our work**

**Preprocess the data:**
- Identify and fill in missing values
- Replace the real number data type with the integer type
- Delete duplicate data
- Categorize the data

**Answer these questions:**
- Is there a connection between having kids and repaying a loan on time?
- Is there a connection between marital status and repaying a loan on time?
- Is there a connection between income level and repaying a loan on time?
- How do different loan purposes affect on-time loan repayment?

# Project_03. Analysis of clients behavior for telecom operator Megaline
**Project description**

The telecom operator Megaline offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.

We'll have the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Our job is to analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.

# Project_07. Market research for opening a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles
We've decided to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. The project is promising but expensive, so we decided to try to attract investors. They're interested in the current market conditions - will we be able to maintain our success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off? We were asked to prepare some market research. We have open-source data on restaurants in LA.

# Project_08. Analysis of user behavior in the food application
We are working at a startup that sells food products. We need to investigate user behavior for the company's app.

We have to study the sales funnel and find out how users reach the purchase stage, how many users actually make it to this stage? How many get stuck at previous stages? Which stages in particular?

The designers would like to change the fonts for the entire app, but the managers are afraid the users might find the new design intimidating. They decide to make a decision based on the results of an A/A/B test.

The users are split into three groups: two control groups get the old fonts and one test group gets the new ones. We need to find out which set of fonts produces better results.

We'll be using the same dataset for general analytics and for A/A/B analysis.
