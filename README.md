# Project_01. Analyzing borrowers' risk of defaulting

Our project is to prepare a report for a bank's loan division. We'll need to find out if a customer's marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers' credit worthiness.

The main aim of the project is to build a credit scoring of a potential customer. The credit scoring is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.
Plan of our work

**Preprocess the data:**
- Identify and fill in missing values
- Replace the real number data type with the integer type
- Delete duplicate data
- Categorize the data

**Answer these questions:**
- Is there a connection between having kids and repaying a loan on time?
- Is there a connection between marital status and repaying a loan on time?
- Is there a connection between income level and repaying a loan on time?
- How do different loan purposes affect on-time loan repayment?

# Project_02. Research on vehicle sales ads

We need to analyze data for one year and determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle on the web site Crankshaft List.

The dataset contains the following columns:
- price
- model_year
- model
- condition
- cylinders
- fuel — gas, diesel, etc.
- odometer — the vehicle's mileage when the ad was published
- transmission
- paint_color
- is_4wd — whether the vehicle has 4-wheel drive (Boolean type)
- date_posted — the date the ad was published
- days_listed — from publication to removal
